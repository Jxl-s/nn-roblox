# Basic Neural Network module for Roblox

An implementation of a basic feedforward neural network in Roblox, that I made for my personal projects.

The purpose of this was to explore AI in 2021, so I decided to implement it
in Roblox instead of in Python, since Python already has many libraries (e.g. numpy) that provide abstractions.

# Examples

I have used it in a few personal projects back in 2021 when I was coding on Roblox.

1. [Digit Classification - MNIST](https://www.roblox.com/games/6916066275/mnist-number-classification)
2. [Reinforcement Learning - Flappy Bird](https://www.roblox.com/games/6920630175/flappy-AI)

Unfortunately, the parameters for the number classifier are lost, since it was stored on a cloud service
which I lost access to. Though, it was originally trained only for 5 minutes, and it can be re-trained one day.

# Disclaimer

This is just a toy that I was playing around with back in 2021. It works, but
I don't recommend using it since it's most likely unstable, and you can find better implementations
somewhere.
